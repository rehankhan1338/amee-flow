Today, this mission is more important than ever to people who need assessment/evaluation in their programs around the world. We are working diligently to deliver this promise. We operate with high levels of integrity and respect that Dr. Camara put in place. It is because of these values that MSSRA will make a difference in the lives of faculty, teachers, administrators and other constituents. </p>
